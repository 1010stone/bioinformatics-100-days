# Workflow for multi-omics analysis with MulyiAssayExperiment - part3
## The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as MultiAssayExperiment objects
## Utilities for TCGA
- "Simplification" of curatedTCGAData objects
- What types of samples are in the data?
- Curated molecular subtypes
- Converting TCGA UUIDs to barcodes and back
## Plotting, correlation, and other analyses
- How many miniACC samples have data for each combination of assays?
- Kaplan-meierplot stratified by pathology_N_stage
- Multivariate Cox regression including RNA-seq, copy number, and pathology
- Correlation between RNA-seq and copy number 
- Identifying correlated principal components
- Annotating with ranges
