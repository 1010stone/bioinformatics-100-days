### Constructing a GRanges object from data.frame
### Basic manipulation of GRanges objects
- seqnames(), ranges(), strand(),granges(),start(),end(),width(),mcols(),seqinfo(),names(),length()
### subsetting GRanges objects
### Splitting and combining GRanges objects
### Aggregating GRanges obejects
### Basic interval operations for GRanges objects
### Interval set operations for GRanges objects
### Finding overlaps between GRanges objects
### Example: exploring BigWig files from AnnotationHub
- extracting data from AnnotationHub
- reading BigWig files
### Worked example: coverage analysis of BAM files
