## Finding Unique Values in Uniq

Unix's uniq takes lines from a file or standard input stream, and outputs all lines with consecutive duplicates removed.

```{}
$ cat letters.txt A
A
B
C
B
C
C
C
$ uniq letters.txt 
A
B 
C 
B 
C
```

If we want to find all unique lines in a file, we would first sort all lines using sort so that all identical lines are grouped next to each other, and then run uniq. 
```{}
$ sort letters.txt | uniq 
A
B
C
```

If we had lowercase letters mixed in this file as well, we could add the option -i to uniq to be case insensitive.

Option -c shows the counts of occurrences next to the unique lines.
```{}
$ uniq -c letters.txt 
2 A
1 B 
1 C 
1 B 
3 C
$ sort letters.txt | uniq -c 
2 A
2 B 
4 C
```

Combnined with other Unix tools like grep and cut, sort and uniq can be used to summarized columns of tabular data:
```{}
$ grep -v "^#" Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf | cut -f3 | sort | uniq -c
25901 CDS
7588 UTR
36128 exon
2027 gene
2290 start_codon
2299 stop_codon
4993 transcript
```

With the -d option, uniq outputs duplicated lines only.
