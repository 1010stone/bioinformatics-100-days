## Subshells

If we run two commands with command1; command2, command2 will always run, regardless of whether command1 exits successfully.
In contrast, if we use command1 && commands, command2 will only run if command1 completed with a zero-exit status.
Checking exit status with pipes unfortunately gets tricky.

Subshells allow us to execute sequential commands together in a separate shell process.
```{}
$ echo "this command"; echo "that command" | sed 's/command/step/' 
this command
that step
$ (echo "this command"; echo "that command") | sed 's/command/step/' 
this step
that step
```

In the first example, only the second command's standard out is piped into sed.
This is because your sell interpret echo "this command" as one command and echo "that command" | sed 's/command/step/' as a second separate command.
