# RNA-seq analysis (RNA123 workflow)
## Data packaging
- Reading in count-data
- Organizing sample imformation
- Organizing gene annotations

## Data preprocessing
- Transformations from the raw-scale
- Removing genes that are lowly expressed

## Differential expression analysis 
- Creating a design matrix and contrasts
- Removing heteroscedascity from count data
- Examining the number of DE genes
- Examining individual DE genes from top to bottom
-  Useful graphical representations of differential expression results
